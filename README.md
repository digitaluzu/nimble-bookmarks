# FAQ

### Can I change the default keyboard shortcut?
Yes.

By default, the keyboard shortcut to open the popup is `Ctrl+B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+B` (Mac).

You can change this by going to Settings => Extensions. Scroll to the bottom and click the "Keyboard shortcuts" link. In the popup window, set the desired keyboard shortcut for Nimble Bookmarks.

### How can I search through my bookmarks?
